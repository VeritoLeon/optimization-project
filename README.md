### Optimizations
At <a href="http://veritoleon.github.io/optimization-project/views/pizza.html">pizza.htlm</a> you can check the optimization changes I made. In summary, they are:
* Took all the calculations I could out of the loops
* <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-javascript">Optimized concatenation</a>
* <a href="">Reduced the number of backgound pizzas (given that the 200 weren't visible)</a>
* <a href="http://css-tricks.com/using-requestanimationframe/">Used requestAnimationFrame() to the bg pizzas creation and updatePositions methods</a>

Also, I guided myself a lot from the <a href="https://piazza.com/class/i0sf6tsmg0r7do">piazza forums</a>.
